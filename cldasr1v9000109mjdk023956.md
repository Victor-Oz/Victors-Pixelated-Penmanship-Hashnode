# My ReactJs Journey

As a Chemical Engineering Student, transitioning fully into the tech industry, my decision to learn ReactJS was driven by my passion for software development. Learning a new technology can be intimidating, especially for someone who is new to the field. However, with the right approach, I was able to quickly become proficient in building simple web applications using ReactJS.

My first few days learning ReactJS began with a lot of research. I spent hours reading articles and tutorials online, familiarizing myself with the basics of the library. I also took several online courses to gain a better understanding of how ReactJS works and how it differs from other JavaScript libraries.

The first thing I learned about ReactJS was that it uses a component-based architecture. This means that the application is broken down into small, reusable components that can be easily manipulated and reused throughout the application. This was a new concept for me, as my background in chemical engineering had not exposed me to this type of approach in web development.

Once I had a basic understanding of the component-based architecture, I began to dive deeper into the library, learning about the different lifecycle methods and how to use them. I also learned about the Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM, and how it improves the performance of ReactJS applications.

After a few days of learning, I felt confident enough to start building my first ReactJS application. I started with a pet breed app, which allowed me to practice using state and props as well as working with forms and events. This was a great way for me to apply the concepts I had learned and to see the power of ReactJS in action.

I also started to learn about React's ecosystem. I learned about popular libraries and frameworks that are commonly used with ReactJS, such as Redux and React Router. These libraries make it easier to manage the state of a React application and handle routing, respectively.

Overall, my first few days learning ReactJS were challenging but also very rewarding. The library has a steep learning curve, but with the right resources and a lot of practice, anyone can learn it. I am excited to continue learning and building more complex applications using ReactJS as I transition fully into the tech industry.

In conclusion, learning ReactJS requires patience and persistence, especially as a recent graduate. You'll have to put in the time and effort to truly understand how the library works and how to effectively use it to build web applications. But once you've mastered it, you'll be able to build powerful, interactive web applications with ease.
